# Bootstrap Block-Grid

_Block grids give you a way to evenly split contents of a list within the grid. If you wanted to create a row of five images
or paragraphs that need to stay evenly spaced no matter the screen size, the block grid is for you._ - Foundation 5 Documentation

Block-grid functionality implemented from [Zurb's Foundation 5](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/block_grid.html) for
use with Twitter Bootstrap 3.x.
